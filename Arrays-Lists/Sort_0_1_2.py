#Given an array/list consisting of only 0's, 1's and 2's. Your task is to sort the given list.

#Test Case 1 --> [1, 1, 2, 0, 2, 0, 0, 2, 0]
#Test Case 2 --> [2, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1, 1, 2, 1]
#Test Case 3 --> [1, 0, 0, 0, 0, 0, 2, 1, 1]

#I have solved this problem on various platforms like Leetcode, GeeksForGeeks, Codestudio(Coding Ninjas). You can use the test cases available on those
#portals.Both the approaches works fine for any test case.

#Brute force approach
