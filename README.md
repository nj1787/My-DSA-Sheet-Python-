# My-DSA-Sheet-Python-

This is my DSA sheet consists of the list of problems topic wise which I practised for my interview preparation. 
The Wiki of this repository consist of Pseudo Code along with the approach discussion(Brute Force--->Optimised) which I have used to solve all the mentioned problems. Time Complexity is also taken into consideration.

Please note that I have provided the complete solution for all the problems in this repository and that is done deliberatly to enhance my github profile.
It would be great if you only refer to the solution of the problems once you have attempted yourself.
